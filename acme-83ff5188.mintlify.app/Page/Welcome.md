## About
I build production-ready LLM-driven applications, developer tooling, and open-source experiments that make advanced models useful in real products. I focus on performance, reproducibility, and great developer experience — turning prototypes into polished, maintainable systems.

- 🔭 Currently building: low-latency LLM infra, conversational UI components, and developer starter kits  
- 🌱 Learning: model optimization, efficient embeddings, and vector search  
- 👯 Open to: collaboration on AI tooling, Web3 integrations, and full‑stack product work  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love turning research prototypes into delightful UIs and clean APIs

## How I work
- Ship fast prototypes, validate with users, then harden the successful ones for production.  
- Prioritize observability, cost, and performance early in ML/LLM features.  
- Document architecture and provide reproducible examples so contributors ramp quickly.

---

## Quick start (for contributors)
1. Fork the repo for the project you want to work on.  
2. Read the CONTRIBUTING.md and run the dev setup (look for /docs or README in each repo).  
3. Open small PRs with focused changes; add tests or demo screenshots when relevant.  
4. If you want mentorship on a feature, open an issue titled "RFC: <short feature name>".

---

## Roadmap & priorities
- Low-latency LLM serving with robust observability and auto-scaling  
- Reusable conversational UI components and starter kits (Next.js + TypeScript)  
- Tutorials and sample apps to help devs adopt model-driven architectures
